# 🜏 Code Crusade

> “Logic is the blade. Code is the battlefield. Every problem is a foe, and only the clever survive.”

Welcome to **Code Crusade**, a journey through the realms of **Project Euler**.  
Here, numbers hide secrets, sequences guard treasures, and only the sharpest minds prevail.

##  The Quest

Each problem is a **challenge**, each solution a **victory**.  
This crusade sharpens **logic, strategy, and code mastery** — forging the mind like a weapon.
